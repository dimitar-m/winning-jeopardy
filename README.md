# 🧠 Jeopardy Data Analysis: Word Patterns and Winning Insights  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project analyzes over **200,000 Jeopardy questions** to uncover patterns in word usage, question reuse, and potential strategies for improving performance in the game.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals  
- 🔍 **Identify Word Overlap**: Analyze how often words from the answers appear in the corresponding questions.  
- 🔁 **Question Reuse Analysis**: Track word repetition across different episodes to identify recurring topics.  
- 📈 **Word Distribution Trends**: Examine how word usage patterns evolve over time.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques  
- 🐍 **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis using `pandas` and `numpy`.  
- 📊 **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive and reproducible analysis.  
- 📐 **Chi-Square Tests**: Statistical tests to identify significant differences in word distributions.  
- 🧹 **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and standardizing text for word pattern detection.  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- 📌 **6% of questions** contain words directly related to the answer.  
- 🔍 Certain **topics are reused** consistently across episodes.  
- 🧠 **Question structure** follows distinct, recurring patterns over time.
